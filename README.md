# Regularizing Generative Adversarial Networks under Limited Data
[[Project Page]](https://hytseng0509.github.io/lecam-gan)[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03310)

Implementation for our GAN regularization method. The proposed regularization 1)
improves the performance of GANs under limited training data, and 2) complements
the exisiting data augmentation approches.

## Installation and Usage

We provide three implementations: [biggan_cifar](biggan_cifar), [biggan_imagenet](biggan_imagenet), and [stylegan2](stylegan2). Plesase refer to the `README.md` file under each sub-folder for the installation and usage guides.
